Task Title: Develop Research Plan

User Story: As a product manager, I want to conduct user interviews with our target audience to identify their pain points and requirements, 
so that we can create a product that meets their needs.

Description: Create a comprehensive research plan outlining the steps and methods to be used to gather information about the target audience and their needs.

Effort estimate: 7 hours

Assigned to: Product Manager

Priority: High

Notes: The research plan should include details on the target audience demographics, behavior, preferences, and pain points. 
It should also outline the research methods to be used, such as surveys, interviews, and focus groups, and specify the tools 
and resources required for each method. The plan should be reviewed and approved by the project manager before proceeding with any research activities.
