Initiative: Objectives and Requirements

This initiative involves laying out the specific objectives of the website for the future, as well as the requirements

Goals: 
1) Determine the specific goals of the website and what we hope it does
2) Establish a target audience for our site
3) Create a visually appealing website

Scope: The scope of this initiative is anything that involves the specific content of the website. It will include the physical content on the website,
as well as how the website visually looks. We will determine these factors once we have a specific target audience

Outcomes:
1) A clear focus on what we hope to accomplish
2) A specific demographic we hope to create content for
3) A visually appealing website that anybody can enjoy

Deliverables:
1) A list of the content we hope to provide
2) A schedule

Milestones:
1) Establish the content we want and our target demographics (1 month)
2) Create a template of what we want our website to look like (2 weeks)

Constraints:
1) Resources
2) Availability to people - if nobody works with us we have no target demographic
3) Meeting technical requirements

Assumptions: 
1) People are willing to give some information to us
2) Input can be given at any stage of development

Risks:
1) If we find we have the wrong target demographic, we may need to restart development
2) Giving out content that is undesired

Dependencies:
1) Stakeholders. Without them, we will never complete this project.
2) People willing to share what they specifically want

Team:
1) Project Manager (oversees the project)
2) Content Strategist (looks at what people want)
3) Content Strategist (see above)

Epics:

Test Plan:
Review project objectives and scope with stakeholders: This step involves reviewing the project objectives and scope with stakeholders to ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding the goals and desired outcomes of the project.
Conduct research to identify target audience and their needs: This step involves conducting research to identify the target audience and their needs. The research may include surveys, focus groups, and other methods to gather information about the target audience.
Define user stories and acceptance criteria: This step involves defining the user stories and acceptance criteria for the project. User stories should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, and acceptance criteria should be clearly defined and agreed upon by all stakeholders.
Develop a prototype: This step involves developing a prototype of the website or application based on the user stories and acceptance criteria. The prototype should be tested and refined as necessary to ensure that it meets the requirements of the project.
