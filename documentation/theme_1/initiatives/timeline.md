Initiative: Create a timeline for development
This initiative involves creating a general plan for how this website will be developed and made available to the general public.

Goals:
1) Define project requirements, deadlines, potential issues along the way
2) Establish milestones, as well as what we hope to accomplish in each milestone
3) Ensure we do not go over budget
4) Allow team members to effectively and efficiently communicate.

Scope: 
This initiative covers all planning aspects of developing a website, including but not limited to budgeting, scheduling and testing.
We will need to be certain that our team members can effectively communicate about these things in order for things to go as we plan them to.

Outcomes: 
1) A strong team is formed with everybody having different strengths
2) A full schedule, including milestones along the way
3) A plan on how to accomplish all the smaller tasks

Deliverables: 
1) A full schedule
2) Requirements document
3) Establish communication methods

Milestones: 
1) Requirements Document (3 weeks)
2) Full schedule (2 weeks)
3) Communication Methods (1 week)

Constraints:
1) Limited budget
2) Not much time to create the full project
3) Legal requirements must be considered

Assumptions:
1) All workers are able to complete given tasks using previously acquired skills
2) All workers are aware of what they are getting in to
3) They will have people giving feedback as they develop the website

Dependencies: 
1) Availability of feedback
2) Availability of outside resources for development

Team
1) Project Manager (Leader of the whole project, also must ensure legal requirements are met)
2) Web Developer (responsible for developing the webpage)
3) Web Developer (see above)

Epics:
- [Determine the basic website structure](documentation/theme_1/initiatives/epics/timeline.md)

Test Plan:
Functional testing: Test that the timeline accurately reflects the development process and includes all necessary tasks and milestones.
Usability testing: Test that the timeline is clear and easy to understand, and that it provides a useful tool for managing the project.
Performance testing: Test that the timeline can handle the expected load of users and tasks without becoming slow or crashing.
Security testing: Test that the timeline is secure and protected from unauthorized access or manipulation.
