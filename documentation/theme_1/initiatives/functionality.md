and legal requirements are met.

Outcomes:
1) A simple website that meets needs of the target audience
2) An overall positive user experience thanks to easy navigation
3) Improved visibility on search engines

Deliverables:
1) Basic website structure and layout
2) Basic functionality
3) Wireframe

Milestones:
1) Completion of the website wireframe (3 weeks)
2) Basic structure and layout (3 weeks)
3) Implement basic functionality (3 weeks)

Constraints: 
1) Limited Budget
2) Limited availability of appropriate content
3) Limited availability of optimization tools

Assumptions: 
1) The website will be developed using common tools
2) The target audience is clearly defined and can be easily reached through online channels.

3) The project is dependent on the availability of appropriate website design and optimization tools and technologies.

Epics:
- [Determine the basic website structure](documentation/theme_1/initiatives/epics/basic_structure.md)

Test Plan:
Unit testing: This will involve testing individual components of the website, such as buttons, forms, and other features to ensure they function properly.
Integration testing: This will involve testing how different components of the website work together, such as how the navigation bar interacts with the different pages.
User acceptance testing: This will involve testing the website's functionality from the perspective of the end user. This includes testing the website's responsiveness, ease of use, and overall user experience.
Performance testing: This will involve testing the website's ability to handle a large number of users and traffic, and ensuring that it loads quickly and without errors.
